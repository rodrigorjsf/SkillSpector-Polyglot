## Optional Dependencies (mcp extra)

Installed when a consumer asks for the `mcp` extra — `pip install
skillspector[mcp]`, and the `dev` extra pulls it in as well — and redistributed
on the same footing as the runtime dependencies above once they do. The `dev`
extra itself is deliberately absent from these notices: it declares tooling for
working *on* this project rather than capability a consumer installs to *use*
the distribution, so listing it would overstate what the distribution contains.

Like the section above, this lists the **directly declared** dependencies only —
the names this distribution itself declares. What each of them in turn pulls in
is chosen by the installer, varies with resolver, lockfile and platform, and is
disclosed by that dependency's own notices rather than restated here. Where an
extra composes another by naming this distribution back — `skillspector[mcp]`,
which is how `dev` obtains it — that self-reference is not a third party and is
listed nowhere: the extra it names is disclosed by its own section above.
